The core codes of the system is uploaded in the script folder, and the data samples are store in zenodo(https://zenodo.org/records/14039006?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJpZCI6ImQzODg4ZDlhLWZhZmUtNDRlZS1hNmI4LTdjNGIwODAwNTg1NCIsImRhdGEiOnt9LCJyYW5kb20iOiI0YTkxYmFjNTA4ZWNmOTVhYTRmYzg5YTI4NmExMzk1MCJ9.zUuxBDX29Z3Y0VvgvB850-1dBUN8GKlDx7R3tZ6785_azAEyIuJJujYDHSK11QJRiRSRsc08XizUNPNaDYp9eA).

For example, in sample1, the original data consists of CT images (CT data). Through software processing, a navigation file (.v3d) and a scene file (.v3p) are generated. The navigation file is used for visual design during MR surgical navigation, while the scene image is the saved result (General visualization scene picture) and is used for comparison with manual precision.
